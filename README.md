# Calories Burned Prediction


## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 15,000 users to explore factors affecting calories burned during physical activity. Using features such as age, gender, height, weight, activity duration, heart rate, and body temperature, the analysis identifies patterns and builds predictive models to estimate calories burned. <br><br>
## Key Highlights
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, correlations, and gender-specific patterns.
Visualized relationships using histograms, scatterplots, and 3D plots. <br>
Built predictive models using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, achieving R² = 1.00 with Random Forest.<br>
Identified key predictors like duration and heart rate influencing calories burned.<br>
Evaluated models with MAE, RMSE, and R², providing actionable insights for fitness tracking and calorie estimation.<br><br>
## Technologies & Tools
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn<br>
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)<br>
Visualization: 2D and 3D plotting
